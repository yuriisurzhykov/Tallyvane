 * "Unsupported color format" the moment a diagram tried to use

 * Fixed at the source, not by working around Mermaid specifically: every
 * color primitive in this system is already an `hsl()` string (DS001), and
 * `hsl()` has its OWN native alpha syntax (`hsl(H S% L% / A%)`) — setting
 * that directly produces a color visually IDENTICAL to
 * `color-mix(in srgb, hsl(H S% L%) A%, transparent)` (both mean "this hue/
 * saturation/lightness, at A% opacity"), except it's a plain color literal
 * every consumer (a browser, Mermaid, this package's own `hslStringToRgb01`)
 * can parse directly — exactly the property `generated/resolved.ts` (read by
 * every non-CSS adapter) needs and `color-mix()` never had.
 * `color-mix()` stays as a defensive fallback for the one case this
 * shouldn't ever hit in practice: a resolved value that ISN'T a plain
 * `hsl()` string despite DS001 — never silently producing a wrong color.
