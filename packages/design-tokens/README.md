## 2026-08-21 — named-constant exemption closed; Lucide `size={n}` closed

`no-raw-dimension-value` used to inspect only a **string literal** inside
`style={{ width: "26px" }}`. A named constant (`const BOX = "1.25rem"`),
`N + "px"`, `` `${N}px` ``, `mergeStyle`'s extra object, and an extracted
`wrapperStyle` all slipped through — and several consuming-project READMEs
documented the named identifier as the official exemption. An agent used
that hole (`EXPAND_COLUMN_WIDTH_PX + "px"`). The value was still a
hardcode; only the AST shape had changed.

The rule is now fail-closed: it resolves same-file identifiers, treats an
imported identifier as unknown (flag), walks `mergeStyle` arguments and
extracted objects, flags React's unitless pixel numbers (`height: 32`), and
allows only `var()`/`calc()`/`clamp()`/`min()`/`max()`, `ch`, runtime
(parameter / call / member / `undefined`), and a complete
`@architecture-exception` that names this rule and an ADR. The message
says to use a token resource, not to extract a constant.
`no-arbitrary-dimension-class` likewise flags `` `w-[${n}px]` ``, which no
single template quasi used to match.

`no-raw-icon-size` is a third rule for `lucide-react` `size={16}` /
`size={CONST}` — an SVG attribute the style rule never sees. Replacement
is a token class (`h-(--control-icon) w-(--control-icon)`).
`Button size="sm"` is out of scope because that `size` is a variant name,
not a pixel.

The color twin (`const C = "#fff"`) is the same hole and is **not** closed
in this pass.

Worth recording because the previous exemption was not an accident of the
regex — it was written into READMEs as the way to stay clean. Closing it
without a token to point at would have left components with nowhere legal
to put a length, which is why `--control-icon` / `--control-box` and the
component tokens landed in the same change.

## 2026-08-18 — the vendoring immediately found a version it had never been checked against

`package.json` declares `eslint: ^10.8.0`, but the install it actually type-checked
against in Portfolio-Website was **9.39.5** — npm's flat `node_modules` handed it a
copy hoisted from the workspace root instead of the range it asked for. Installed
here under pnpm's strict resolution, the declared range resolved honestly to
`10.8.1`, and four files stopped compiling: ESLint 10's `Rule.RuleListener` no
longer gives a contextual type to a non-ESTree visitor key, so `JSXAttribute(node)`
became an implicit `any`.

Fixed by typing the parameter explicitly — `JSXAttribute(node: any)` — which is
what `ast-helpers.ts`'s own header already declares as this file group's
convention ("AST nodes are typed loosely (`any`) throughout, deliberately").
Nothing about the rules' behaviour changed; all 212 tests pass unchanged before
and after.

Worth recording for two reasons. It is the exact class of defect a strict
dependency tree exists to surface — code validated against a version it never
declared, working purely because a sibling package happened to hoist another one.
And it means Portfolio-Website is still type-checking this package against
ESLint 9; whenever it moves to pnpm or bumps its root ESLint, it will meet the
same four errors and can take this fix.

A project-agnostic design-token engine: an **authoring API**
(`definePrimitives`/`defineContract`/`defineTheme`/`defineComponentTokens`/
`defineComposite`) that every token layer is constructed *through* — not a
bag of validator utilities called separately after the fact — plus a
compiler (reference resolution, cycle detection, usage-graph promotion
analysis, CSS/plain-data serialization) and a custom ESLint rule pair.

This package ships **zero color/role names of its own**. `surfacePrimary`,
`statusDanger`, `codeBlock.keyword` — none of that vocabulary lives here.
It lives in the consuming project (in this repo: `packages/frontend-shared/src/shared/ui/theme/`, shared between `frontend` and `frontend-admin` — see that package's own README for why it's a separate workspace package rather than living inside either app).
What this package provides is the *shape* every project's vocabulary has to
take, and the machinery that enforces it.

## Why this exists (2026-08-14)

**What needed doing.** The repo's own `ARCHITECTURE.md` had already designed
a layered token system (primitive → semantic → composite) but left three
real problems unsolved: nothing stopped a "global" semantic role from
existing for a single component's sake, nothing caught a primitive value
being reused by two unrelated components for two unrelated reasons, and
nothing made "required vs. optional" a checkable property instead of a
convention. A separate design conversation (see the plan this was built
from) worked out a formal answer — a promotion-graph the compiler builds
from real usage, not guessed — and asked for it to be genuinely portable to
a *different* project, not just a bigger file in `frontend/`.

**What was actually done, including the wrong turns:**

- **First draft: `mergeTokenTree(base, overrides)` typed `overrides` as
  `DeepPartial<typeof base>`.** Looked right until the real call site
  (`themes/dark.ts` merging shared roles with per-theme roles — two mostly
  *disjoint* key sets, not one overriding the other) failed to typecheck:
  `DeepPartial<Base>` can only narrow keys `Base` already has, never add
  new ones. Fixed by making `mergeTokenTree` generic over two *independent*
  type parameters (`TBase`, `TOverrides`) returning `TBase & TOverrides` —
  the real shape of "combine two mostly-different objects," not "partially
  override one."
- **First draft of `defineXxx()`'s return types preserved the caller's
  exact literal type** (`definePrimitives<T>(tree: T): PrimitiveLayer<T>`).
  Broke the moment a real project tried to put several different
  primitive objects into one `CompilerInput.primitives: Record<string,
  PrimitiveLayer<TokenTree>>` — TypeScript won't implicitly widen a
  concrete object type to an index-signature type once it's already gone
  through a generic function and been assigned to a variable. Fixed by
  having every authoring function return the *generic* `PrimitiveLayer<TokenTree>`
  (etc.) instead of `PrimitiveLayer<T>` — the exact input shape is still
  checked on the way IN (that's what catches a real authoring mistake), it
  just isn't preserved on the way OUT, where nothing needs it anyway.
- **DS101/DS102 (unused / single-consumer global-semantic role) originally
  fired for every REQUIRED role**, since a required role like
  `interactivePrimary` is mostly consumed through the Tailwind adapter
  (invisible to this token-to-token graph), not by another token. Fixed by
  excluding a category's required paths (from its `Contract`) from both
  checks — they're the ONE case where "no component/composite references
  this" is normal, not a smell.
- **A real DS007 (duplicate generated variable name) collision, found
  live, not hypothetical:** a flat category's primitive tier and its
  semantic tier can name a leaf identically — `radius`'s primitive `pill`
  step and its semantic `pill` role both flattened to `--ds-radius-pill`.
  Fixed by prefixing flat-semantic output with `["semantic", category]`
  instead of `[category]`. Deliberately NOT applied to color's theme
  roles — that collision never actually occurs there (verified by the same
  check simply never firing for color), and changing it would deviate from
  `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s already-accepted `--ds-color-*` contract for no reason.
- **Mutation testing found a real, literal zero:** `serializers/shadow.ts`
  had no dedicated test file at all (only exercised indirectly through
  `compile.test.ts`), and the first real Stryker run measured this
  package's overall score at 56.80% — nowhere near the guessed 75%
  originally written into `stryker.config.mjs` before ever running it
  once. Corrected: wrote `shadow.test.ts` (now 100%), strengthened
  `css-value.test.ts`/`gradient.test.ts`, and tightened 3 assertions in
  `compile.test.ts` to check actual DS201/DS102 message text instead of
  just "an error was thrown." Real, measured score after that pass:
  **72.35%** (620/857 mutants killed). `compile.ts` (58.20%) and the two
  ESLint rule files (61–69%) are the remaining honest gaps — mostly
  `StringLiteral` mutants inside long human-facing error messages and
  defensive `[]`/`{}` initializers, lower-value to chase further than the
  structural bugs this suite already caught live (see below).
  `stryker.config.mjs`'s `thresholds.break: 70` is this real number minus
  headroom, not a guess.

**Proof this catches real bugs, not just theoretical ones** (all found
*while migrating this repo's own color tokens onto this engine, in the same
change that built it*):

- `components/code-block.ts`'s `keyword` and `composites/shadows.ts`'s
  brand-colored shadows both referenced `{color.brand.500}` directly — a
  real DS201 crossing, resolved by routing both through the
  `interactivePrimary` role that already existed for exactly this meaning.
- `components/code-block.ts`'s syntax `className` color and
  `components/skill-card.ts`'s decorative icon color both reached for
  `{color.accent.purple}` directly — DS201 again, this time a genuine
  shared meaning ("the site's one decorative violet accent"), resolved by
  promoting to a new `theme.color.decorativeAccent` role.
- Four `theme.color.meshSpot*` roles existed for a single composite's sake
  — DS102, resolved by inlining the primitives directly into that
  composite instead.

## 2026-08-14 — A real ReDoS finding (GitHub Advanced Security / CodeQL), fixed

`no-arbitrary-color-class.ts`'s `COLOR_BEARING_ARBITRARY_CLASS` matched
against the WHOLE className string with only a soft `(?:^|[\s"'`])`
lookback — not a hard `^...$` anchor. `.match()` without the `g` flag
retries at every position where that lookback succeeds, and at each one,
the color-function alternatives' `[^)]*` scanned forward with no bound. A
className with many repeated, never-closed prefixes made this genuinely
O(n²): one scan attempt per candidate start position, each itself O(n) in
the worst case. CodeQL flagged this correctly (6 separate alert entries,
one per color-function alternative) — not a false positive to dismiss.

Fixed by splitting the className on whitespace FIRST (a Tailwind class is
inherently a whitespace-delimited token — this is also just the
semantically correct unit to check, not only a performance fix) and
matching each token against a fully `^...$`-anchored pattern with a
bounded inner scan (`{0,100}`, not `*`). No per-token attempt can exceed
O(1) work, so the whole check is O(n) in the string's total length.
Verified live, not just reasoned about: added a regression test feeding
the exact adversarial shape (`" accent-[rgb(".repeat(20000)`, ~260,000
characters) and asserting a real wall-clock bound (`<500ms`) — a
regression here shows up as a hung test, not a wrong answer. Also caught
in the process: the existing hsl() test case
(`text-[hsl(20 94% 61%)]`) used a literal space inside the arbitrary
value, which isn't valid Tailwind syntax to begin with (Tailwind itself
requires `_` in place of a space there, for the exact same "classes are
whitespace-delimited" reason) — fixed to `text-[hsl(20_94%_61%)]`.

**Correction, found the same day:** that check was wrong about one file.
`references.ts`'s `TOKEN_REFERENCE = /\{([^}]+)}/g` has the exact same
shape — `g` flag, no `^` anchor, so `.test()`/`.replace()`/`.matchAll()`
(its 3 real call sites: `isReferenceLike`, `resolveString`,
`collectReferences`) all retry at every character position on failure, and
its `[^}]+` scanned unboundedly. CodeQL flagged all 3 call sites
separately (reproduction: many repetitions of `"{{|"`). Fixed the same
way — `[^}]{1,200}`, not `[^}]+` — and bounded `ALPHA_CALL` and
`validate.ts`'s `REFERENCE_LIKE` too, even though both are fully
`^...$`-anchored (a single whole-string attempt, never retried at another
position, so never the same risk) — for one consistent "no unbounded scan
inside braces" invariant across the package, not because they were
independently flagged. Added a regression test for each of the 3 real call
sites, feeding the exact adversarial shape (`"{{".repeat(50000)`) with a
real wall-clock bound, same as the `no-arbitrary-color-class.ts` fix above.

Every remaining regex in this package was checked against the same shape
while investigating this (`RAW_COLOR_VALUE`, `HSL_PATTERN`,
`THEME_OR_SEMANTIC`, `HSL_COLOR`, `COLOR_PROPERTY`, ...) — all of them are
either fully `^...$`-anchored with no unbounded scan, or have no ambiguous
alternation to begin with, so none of them share this risk.

## 2026-08-14 — A real, live bug: Mermaid couldn't render `alpha()`-based colors

Not a lint finding this time — an actual `Diagram render error: Unsupported
color format: "color-mix(in srgb, hsl(20 94% 61%) 12%, transparent)"` from
using the real app. Root cause: `alpha({color.X}, N%)` compiled to a CSS
`color-mix()` call — valid CSS a browser renders fine, but Mermaid's "base"
theme runs every `themeVariable` through its OWN color-math library (no CSS
engine to lean on), which parses a plain `hsl()`/`rgb()`/hex string but not
`color-mix()`.

Fixed at the source, not with a Mermaid-specific workaround: every color
primitive in this system is already validated as an `hsl()` string (DS001),
and `hsl()` has its own native alpha syntax (`hsl(H S% L% / A%)`) —
`color-mix(in srgb, hsl(H S% L%) A%, transparent)` and `hsl(H S% L% / A%)`
are VISUALLY IDENTICAL (both mean "this hue/saturation/lightness at A%
opacity"), but the latter is a plain literal every consumer can parse —
exactly what `generated/resolved.ts` (read by every non-CSS adapter) needs.
`references.ts`'s `resolveString()` now parses the resolved primitive and
re-emits it with the requested alpha via `withAlpha()`; `color-mix()` is
still there as a defensive fallback for a resolved value that somehow isn't
plain `hsl()` despite DS001 — never silently wrong, just documented as a
case that shouldn't occur in practice.

`composites/gradients.ts` (`glow`/`mesh`)'s OWN, separate `color-mix()`
usage for a gradient STOP's opacity (`serializers/gradient.ts`) is
untouched, deliberately — those are CSS-only output (`--ds-gradient-*`),
never read by Mermaid/OG-image/WebGL today. Worth remembering if a future
adapter ever reads a gradient's resolved value directly: the same class of
bug would resurface there.

## 2026-08-14 — DS001's color validators existed, were unit-tested, and were never actually called by the compiler (found by a bot review comment)

`validateColorPrimitiveFormat` and `validateNoRawColorLiterals` were real,
tested functions, exposed via the frontend ESLint config against JSX call
sites — but `compile.ts`'s `validateDesignTokens` only ever ran the
reference-resolution graph checks (DS002/DS006/DS101/DS102/DS201/DS202).
Neither DS001 color validator was invoked anywhere in the compile pipeline
itself. A color primitive authored as `#0d0f14` instead of `hsl(...)`, or a
theme/component color role authored as a raw literal instead of a
`{reference}`, compiled without complaint — exactly the shape of value the
frontend ESLint config is documented to reject, just never checked at the
one point (`tokens:generate`/`tokens:check`) that actually produces the
shipped CSS/data.

Wiring both in turned out to need a third function, not a blind "run the
existing validator on every tree": `validateNoRawColorLiterals` assumes
every string leaf in the tree it's given must be a reference — true for a
theme's `color` category or a (today, 100% color) component-token tree, but
false for a composite recipe. `composites/gradients.ts`'s `Gradient` shape
mixes real color references (`stops[].color`) with legitimate non-reference
structural literals (`type: "radial"`, `position: "30% 30%"`) that were
never meant to route through the token system — running the whole-tree
validator there would have rejected valid, already-shipping data as a false
positive. Added `validateColorFieldsDeep`: walks an arbitrary tree/array and
runs `validateNoRawColorLiterals` only on values under a key literally
named `"color"`, ignoring everything else — covers `Gradient`'s
`stop.color` and `ShadowLayer`'s `layer.color` (both defined in this
package) without hardcoding either shape by name, so a project's own custom
composite kind gets the same coverage for free as long as it names its
color field `color` too.

`validateDesignTokens` now calls: `validateColorPrimitiveFormat` on
`input.primitives.color`; `validateNoRawColorLiterals` on each theme's
`color` category and on every component token tree; `validateColorFieldsDeep`
on every composite. Verified against this repo's own real token source
(`frontend/`'s `tokens:generate`) — no new DS001 errors, only the
pre-existing DS101 warnings, confirming the real `tokens/color.ts`/
`themes/*.ts`/`components/*.ts`/`composites/*.ts` were already compliant
and this wasn't a live bug in THIS project, just an unenforced gap for any
project (including a future one reusing this package) that wasn't.

**Found by mutation testing, not by hand:** the first wiring guarded each
call site (`if (input.primitives.color) { validateColorPrimitiveFormat(...) }`,
`if (colorRoles) validateNoRawColorLiterals(...)`) the way several existing
`compile.ts` checks already do. Both guards' mutants survived. Read what
the mutant actually changed (this rule's own first step) instead of writing
a test to force coverage: `validateNoRawColorLiterals` already returns
immediately for `null`/`undefined` (`node == null`), so its guard was
calling a no-op either way — genuinely equivalent code, not a real branch.
`validateColorPrimitiveFormat`'s guard WAS load-bearing (it required a
`Record<string, unknown>`, and would have thrown a `TypeError` from
`Object.entries(undefined)` on a color-less project) — but the better fix
was making the validator itself tolerate a missing/non-object `node`
(matching the tolerance `validateNoRawColorLiterals` already had), the same
"push a defensive check into the one function that needs it, not every call
site" reasoning as everywhere else this package favors DRY over repeated
ceremony. Removed both call-site guards entirely and added a real test — a
radius-only project with no `color` category anywhere — proving a
color-less project still compiles instead of crashing on either validator.

## 2026-08-15 — DS001's dimension/typography side: `no-arbitrary-dimension-class`/`no-raw-dimension-value`, and why they end up flagging EVERY bare literal, no threshold

Added as the dimension counterpart to the two existing color rules, during a
repo-wide sweep replacing hardcoded `w-[26px]`-style Tailwind values and
inline `style={{ width: "26px" }}` with real design tokens. Shares
`ast-helpers.ts` (extracted from the two color rules for this) —
`isClassNameAttribute`/`isStyleAttribute`/`propertyKeyName`/`walkForStrings`
were duplicated inline in both before this, now a single copy all four rules
import.

**A `minPx` threshold option existed for one round-trip, then was removed
entirely** — worth recording exactly why, since a smaller threshold-based
design is the "obvious" first approach and this project's owner explicitly
rejected it. The first version exempted a literal below a configurable floor
(intended for a consuming project's own smallest primitive step, e.g. 4px)
on the theory that a 2-3px pill/chip-boundary micro-adjustment is "too small
to be a real token concern." Challenged directly: *"why wasn't `gap-[2px]`
actually fixed instead of just exempted?"* — checking for real (not
assuming) found that every one of those cases already had a real fix: this
project's own `xxs` token (4px) or a plain Tailwind numeric utility
(`gap-0.5`, `mt-px`) matched an EXISTING sibling component's already-migrated
pattern exactly (see `packages/frontend-shared/src/shared/ui/theme/README.md`'s 2026-08-15
entry). Once that was true for every case in this codebase, the `minPx`
option had no reason to exist — a threshold is only justified by a value
that genuinely has no real alternative, and none did. Both rules now report
every bare literal unconditionally; the schema is `[]`.

**Same reasoning killed the `vh`/`vw`/`vmin`/`vmax` exemption**, added in
the same round for "relative to the viewport, not a fixed-scale concern."
The project owner's actual position, stated directly: *"in any component we
must use tokens — ours, or Tailwind's own built-ins. Any other value is a
mistake."* No unit gets a free pass just because it isn't px/rem/em/%. In
practice this didn't even cost a new token: `StatusPage.tsx`'s one real
`min-h-[60vh]` case turned out to have a genuine structural fix (the
ancestor layout already provides a `flex`/`flex-1` chain in every context it
renders in — see the same theme README entry), not a value to grandfather
in. `ch` remains the one still-exempt unit — a character-based line-length
tied to font metrics, not a fixed-scale spacing/sizing concern the way `vh`
turned out to be once actually checked.

**Mutation testing, added to this package's scope alongside the two new
rule files:** `ast-helpers.ts` had never been in `stryker.config.mjs`'s
`mutate` list (only the two rules that originally contained its logic
inline were) — adding it surfaced 15 real no-coverage mutants that predate
this session's dimension work, not new bugs. Two categories, both fixed with
a real test (not a suppression, since both are genuinely-unspecified real
`walkForStrings`/`propertyKeyName` shapes, not equivalent code):
- The existing `&&` test asserted on `active && "text-primary"` — a value
  that never matches the dimension regex either way, so it never actually
  proved `LogicalExpression` gets walked at all (the exact "weak assertion
  passes regardless of the mutant" pattern this repo's mutation-testing rule
  warns about). Fixed by using a real dimension-bearing literal on the
  walked branch, and added the three still-untested `walkForStrings` shapes
  real component code in this repo actually uses: an array argument to
  `cn()`, a clsx-style conditional object (`cn({ "gap-[2px]": active })`),
  and a template literal directly in `className` (not just inline `style`,
  already covered there).
- `propertyKeyName`'s `Identifier` vs `Literal` branches were only ever
  exercised by unquoted style keys (`{ width: "26px" }` parses as
  `Identifier`) — every existing test used that shape, so a mutant
  collapsing the `if (key.type === "Identifier")` guard to `if (true)`
  changed nothing observable. Added one test with a quoted key
  (`{ "width": "26px" }`, a `Literal` node) to actually distinguish the two
  branches.

Score after this first pass: 75.65% (up from the prior 73.54% baseline —
`ast-helpers.ts` alone went 51.52% → 77.27%).

## 2026-08-15 (continued) — `break` raised 70 → 85 by closing real gaps across the WHOLE package, not by lowering the bar

Requested directly: raise the mutation-testing threshold to "at least 85%,
ideally 95%." The very first response to that request was to actually
re-measure with a fresh run rather than trust the dated comment above —
which is also exactly the discipline this section is about: a `break`
threshold is only ever allowed to move to match a REAL number, never typed
in as a target and left for the code to catch up to later.

Went file by file through every survived/no-coverage mutant already in
`mutate` (not just the two dimension rules added earlier the same day),
reading what each one actually changed before writing anything — the same
per-mutant discipline the mutation-testing rule asks for on every file, at
package scale for once instead of one function at a time:

- **`compile.ts` (60.30% → 83.42%):** `flatSemantics` (radius/spacing/
  typography's no-theme-axis DS101/DS102 branch) was NEVER exercised
  end-to-end — every existing test used `flatSemantics: {}`. Same for the
  `shadow` half of `serializeCompositesFor` (only `gradient` had a test) and
  a category with no matching `contracts` entry at all (the `?? []`
  fallback). Also found, the same way DS001's color validators were found
  unwired in an earlier entry above: `validateUniqueVariableNames` (DS007)
  was called from `compileDesignTokens` but had ZERO test proving the real
  per-theme assembly loop actually reaches it — added one that collides a
  primitive category's name with a component's, and a second colliding
  through the gradient/color lines specifically (colorLines/gradientLines/
  shadowLines each build their own `.trim().split(":")[0]` list
  independently; a collision through only one of them doesn't prove the
  others are wired).
- **`references.ts` (68.81% → 88.07%):** `typeof null === "object"` is why
  `current == null || typeof current !== "object"` in `getByPath` does NOT
  collapse to `&&` for all inputs — an explicit `null` value (not just a
  missing key) takes a genuinely different path (`||` returns `undefined`
  gracefully; the `&&` mutant tries to index into `null` and throws). Also:
  a reference resolving to a non-scalar (an object) had no test at all, the
  circular-reference and unresolvable-path tests only asserted the error
  TYPE (would pass even with a blanked-out message), and `resolveTree`'s
  array branch was only ever fed all-object arrays (never a MIXED array,
  the one shape that actually proves the ternary isn't just "recurse into
  everything").
- **`no-raw-color-value.ts`/`no-raw-dimension-value.ts` (70%/75% →
  91.67%/90%):** the exact same weak-assertion + missing-guard-test shape
  in both files (they're structural mirrors of each other) — a template-
  literal test that only checked `.toHaveLength(1)` without checking WHICH
  value was reported, no test for a spread element or computed key inside
  the style object, and no test for the two rules' own `isStyleAttribute`/
  value-shape guard clauses failing closed on a non-JSXExpressionContainer
  style value.
- **`ast-helpers.ts` (77.27% → 92.42%):** had no dedicated test file at
  all — only ever exercised indirectly through the 4 rules that import it.
  Added `ast-helpers.test.ts` with direct unit tests, because some AST
  shapes (a `JSXSpreadAttribute` with no `.name` at all, a node whose
  `.type` isn't `"JSXAttribute"`) are literally unreachable through a real
  ESLint `JSXAttribute(node)` visitor — no amount of rule-level test writing
  could ever have reached them.
- **`css-value.ts` (72.44% → 84.25%):** `hslStringToRgb01`'s piecewise
  `hueToChannel` has 4 branches; the only tested hues (red, white, black)
  drove different channels through only 2 of them. Added a golden-value
  sweep across all 6 primary/secondary 60°-spaced hues (yellow/green/cyan/
  blue/magenta) — exact, well-known conversions, not approximated.
- **`gradient.ts` (89.87% → 98.73%), `merge.ts` (90.48% → 100%),
  `usage-graph.ts` (86.67% → 97.78%), `validate.ts` (83.63% → 91.23%):**
  boundary values (opacity/position exactly at 0/1/lastPosition, not just
  inside or outside the range), `&&` vs `||` distinguished with a value
  that's an object on only ONE side (not both), and — the one that repeated
  three times across `usage-graph.ts`'s three `.sort()` calls — every
  existing test happened to insert items in ALREADY-alphabetical order, so
  deleting the sort changed nothing any assertion could see. Fixed with
  inputs inserted in reverse-alphabetical order.

**Real final result: 89.88%** (886 killed / 98 no-coverage / 11 survived /
3 timeout). `break` raised 70 → 85 (`low` 65 → 80, `high` 85 → 90) — real
headroom below the measured number, not at the ceiling, same reasoning as
backend's/frontend's own configs. **Not raised to 95** as also asked: the
real number doesn't clear it, and typing in a threshold above what's
actually true would just fail the very next CI run for no code change,
exactly the thing this rule exists to prevent. The remaining gap is the
same documented shape as the pre-existing baseline — long human-facing
error-message string literals, defensive `[]`/`{}` initializers, and a
handful of `hueToChannel` `ArithmeticOperator` mutants that would need
inputs landing on exact floating-point branch boundaries to distinguish —
a real, honestly-scoped v1 limit, not silently accepted as unfixable
without checking (every mutant list above WAS checked, file by file,
before anything here was written).

## How to use this in a NEW project

1. Add this package as a workspace dependency (see `packages/frontend-shared/package.json`'s
   `"design-token-engine": "workspace:*"` + `frontend-web/next.config.ts`'s
   `transpilePackages` for the exact wiring this repo uses — note that the
   theme SOURCE and the app consuming it are two different workspace
   packages here, which is a wrinkle specific to this repo's two-Next-app
   split, not something a new project needs to replicate).
2. `definePrimitives({...})` for your own scale(s) — any names, any values,
   no constraints. Primitives are addressed only through `{category.path}`
   reference strings, never a hardcoded class name.
3. `defineContract({ category, required: [...] })` — list exactly the
   roles YOUR shared component library's Tailwind classes actually
   consume. This is the one place a required-role list lives; don't invent
   a parallel interface to keep in sync with it.
4. `defineTheme(contract, { ...roles })` — once per theme name for a
   themed category (color, usually), once total for a flat category
   (radius, spacing, ...). Missing a required key throws immediately, at
   import time — not the first time someone remembers to run a checker.
5. `defineComponentTokens(namespace, {...})` / `defineComposite(kind, {...})`
   freely, for anything component- or recipe-specific. No contract, by
   design.
6. Write a `compile.config.ts` (see
   `packages/frontend-shared/src/shared/ui/theme/compiler.config.ts`)
   assembling every module above into this package's `CompilerInput` shape,
   and a `scripts/generate-design-tokens.ts` (see
   `frontend-web/scripts/generate-design-tokens.ts` — `frontend-admin` has an
   identical copy, both pointed at the one theme source) calling
   `compileDesignTokens()` and writing `generated/tokens.css` +
   `generated/resolved.ts`.
7. Write your own `adapters/tailwind.css` mapping the generated `--ds-*`
   variables onto the class-facing names Tailwind's `@theme` reads. Any
   non-CSS consumer (Mermaid, `next/og`, WebGL, ...) reads
   `generated/resolved.ts` ONLY — never this package, never the raw theme
   source (see "Runtime boundary" below).

## Re-skinning an EXISTING project onto a new brand

Copy the primitive file(s), replace the values (`brand.500` etc.) — every
downstream file holds a `{path}` reference, never a value, so nothing else
changes syntactically. Reassigning a role (not just recoloring it) is one
line inside the relevant `defineTheme(...)` call. The `defineContract(...)`
calls almost never change during a re-skin — required-ness is about what
the component library needs structurally, not which brand it's wearing.

## Runtime boundary — read this before importing this package from app code

**Nothing under a project's `adapters/` should import this package at
runtime**, with one narrow, documented exception
(`hslStringToRgb01` — see the comment at its call site in
`packages/frontend-shared/src/shared/ui/theme/` for why a pure,
project-agnostic color-math function is a different concern than "the
compiler"). `compileDesignTokens()`,
`resolveTree()`, the whole authoring API — these are **build-time-only**
dependencies of your `generate-design-tokens.ts` script. Every real runtime
consumer (Mermaid, `next/og`, a WebGL canvas, or any future adapter) reads
the ALREADY-RESOLVED `generated/resolved.ts` instead. This keeps reference
resolution, cycle detection, and the whole validation/authoring engine out
of both the server and client bundles.

## Architecture

```
Primitive (definePrimitives)
   │
   ├──► Global semantic (defineTheme against a Contract)
   │        │
   │        ▼
   └──► Component semantic (defineComponentTokens, no contract)
   │        ▲
   ▼        │
Composite (defineComposite, may reference primitive OR global-semantic)
   │
   ▼
compile() — resolve + validate + usage-graph
   │
   ├──► generated/tokens.css     (CSS custom properties, static, committed)
   └──► generated/resolved.ts   (plain resolved data, for non-CSS adapters)
```

Dependencies point downward only. `tokens/*.ts` never imports from
`themes/`/`components/`/`composites/` — enforced structurally: it would be
a real circular-import error at compile time (DS003), not a runtime check.

## The DS0xx/DS1xx/DS2xx rule family

| Rule | What it catches | Where |
|---|---|---|
| DS001 | Raw color literal outside a primitive layer | `validate.ts` (source), custom ESLint rules (JSX/Tailwind) |
| DS002 | A `{path}` reference that doesn't resolve | `validate.ts` |
| DS003 | Primitive importing from a higher layer | TypeScript's own circular-import error — no runtime code |
| DS004 | A global-semantic role referencing another semantic role instead of a primitive | `validate.ts`, enforced inside `defineTheme()` |
| DS005 | A required key missing from a theme/semantic object | `validate.ts`'s `assertRequiredKeys`, enforced inside `defineTheme()` at construction |
| DS006 | An optional key present in one sibling tree (e.g. one theme) but not another | `validate.ts`'s `checkOptionalKeyParity` (warning) |
| DS007 | Two categories generating the same CSS variable name | `validate.ts`'s `validateUniqueVariableNames` |
| DS101 | A global-semantic role no component/composite references (excludes required roles — see above) | `usage-graph.ts` (warning) |
| DS102 | A global-semantic role consumed by exactly one component/composite namespace | `usage-graph.ts` |
| DS201/202 | A primitive referenced directly by 2+ independent component/composite namespaces | `usage-graph.ts` — collapsed into one check; same mechanism, same fix either way |
| DS203 | A primitive reused repeatedly WITHIN one component namespace | no code needed — it's the absence of a DS201/202 violation |

## Mutation testing

`npm run test:mutation` (Stryker) — see `stryker.config.mjs`'s own comment
for the real, dated baseline numbers and why the threshold is set where it
is. Unlike `backend/`/`frontend/`, this package needs no dedicated
`vitest.mutation.config.ts`: every test here is a plain, DB-free,
jsdom-free Node unit test, so pointing Stryker straight at the normal
`vitest.config.ts` is safe (verified by actually running it, not assumed).
